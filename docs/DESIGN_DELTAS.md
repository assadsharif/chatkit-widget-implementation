# Design Deltas

**Purpose**: Document any deviations from the frozen design at commit [5b2a756](https://github.com/assadsharif/Hackathon_01/commit/5b2a756).

---

## What Goes Here

If you discover a design gap, ambiguity, or need to deviate from the frozen design:

1. Document it here **before** implementing
2. Reference the frozen design artifact
3. Propose a solution that aligns with existing patterns
4. Get approval (or self-approve with clear rationale)
